The XRPTipBot-Skill lets you check your XRP TipBot balance and send tips to your TipBot contacts within a few seconds. All you need is your voice!

In order to use this skill, you need to have all of the following requirements:

- XRP Tip Bot account
- available XRP Tip Bot balance (balance > 0)
- contacts in your XRP Tip Bot App
- an Amazon account
- an Alexa enabled device


To check your balance, use one of the following commands:
- "Alexa, ask Tip Bot for my balance."
- "How many XRP do I have?"
- "What is my balance?"

To send a tip to one of your contacts, just say:
- "Alexa, tell Tip Bot to send a tip to {user_name}"
- "send a tip"
- "send a tip to {user_name}"
- "send 0.01 XRP"

Alexa will then guide you through the dialog for sending a tip to one of your contacts.

IMPORTANT NOTICE:
Due to some limitations of the Alexa voice service, you are only able to give one piece of information at a time:
the amount OR the username.
When providing both, the amount AND the username, alexa will ask you for the username again later in the dialog.
It is recommended to start the dialog with the username. Alexa will ask your for the amount you want to send afterwards.
I hope this will be fixed in the future by Amazon.


Have fun and enjoy the Skill!
